Monster Ternary Operator Challenge
Challenges Faced
While working on this coding exercise, I faced some challenges in understanding how to correctly structure the ternary operator syntax. Initially, I found it a bit tricky to ensure that the conditions and output options were correctly formatted. However, with some practice and experimentation, I was able to overcome these challenges and successfully complete the tasks.

Improvements
One improvement I could make to this code is to add more complex conditions to further demonstrate the versatility of the ternary operator. This would help me deepen my understanding of its capabilities and improve my coding skills overall.

Feelings
I feel satisfied with my progress in completing these challenges. It was a great learning experience, and I feel more confident in my ability to use ternary operators effectively in my code. I also feel motivated to continue exploring and learning more about JavaScript and its various features.
